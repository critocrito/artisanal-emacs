# Artisanal Emacs

> Because crafting an Emacs configuration is an art.

For a long time I maintained my custom Emacs configuration. Life was good, until it wasn't anymore. I then switched to [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) and used it for almost a year. I really liked Doom, until I didn't anymore. This is the latest iteration of my Emacs configuration. It is a work in progress and customized for my needs. I took a lot of code from Doom Emacs, trimmed it down for my purposes and mixed it with my original Emacs configuration.
